## 🎯 Recommended Approach: "Build-Learn-Recall"

### The 3-Phase Learning Cycle

#### Phase 1: LEARN (40% of time)
- Read 20-30 questions daily
- Research and understand concepts
- Write answers in your own words
- Create visual diagrams
- Make connections to previous knowledge

#### Phase 2: BUILD (40% of time)
- Write code for every concept
- Create 3 examples per concept:
  1. Basic example
  2. Practical use case
  3. Mini-project
- Build progressive projects
- Push code to GitHub daily

#### Phase 3: RECALL (20% of time)
- Create flashcards (Anki)
- Self-quiz daily
- Spaced repetition:
  - Review after 1 day
  - Review after 3 days
  - Review after 7 days
  - Review after 30 days
- Teach concepts (blog/video)

## 📅 Daily Routine (4-6 hours)

### Morning (2-3 hours): Theory + Active Recall
1. **Review** (30 min): Yesterday's flashcards
2. **Learn** (90-120 min): 20-30 new questions
3. **Create** (30 min): Flashcards for new concepts

### Afternoon (2-3 hours): Coding + Building
4. **Code** (90 min): Implement 5-10 concepts
5. **Build** (60-90 min): Work on topic project
6. **Review** (30 min): Update logs, plan tomorrow

## 🗓️ Weekly Structure

- **Mon-Thu**: Learn new (80% new, 20% review)
- **Friday**: Review week + Integration project
- **Saturday**: Deep dive weak areas
- **Sunday**: Rest OR passion project

## 📈 Study Techniques

### For Theory (OS, Networks, Databases)
1. Understand → Visualize → Code
2. Create analogies
